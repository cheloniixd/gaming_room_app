The Gaming Room is a client that wanted a simple, web-based team guessing game called "Draw It or Lose It." They needed a cross-platform app that works on all major operating systems and browsers, is easy to set up, secure, and scalable. The software should support multiple teams, unique names, clear access controls, and audit trails.

Personally, I identified the client’s needs and translated them into specific, actionable requirements. I kept the documentation organized and easy to follow, making sure the technical details matched what the client wanted. I also explained my design choices in a way that’s simple for both technical and non-technical readers to understand.

In order to interpret the users needs, I made sure the design supported things like multiple teams, unique names, and easy setup, just like they asked.

In the future, I will continue to focus on language that is clear and accessible, avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary. I will also strive to include more visual aids in my documentation to help convey complex ideas more effectively.
